# apartment-finder
This script uses the requests library to send a request to the specified website (in this case, apartments.com) and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content of the website. It then uses the find_all method to find all the apartment listings on the page and the find method to extract the details of each apartment (name, price, and location).

You can change the url to match your preferences and also add more information to the script as per your requirement.

Keep in mind that this is just an example, and it only scrape the information from one page. You can add a loop to navigate through different pages and get more information. Additionally, this example is done on the assumption that the website does not have any restrictions on scraping, make sure to check the website's policy before scraping.
